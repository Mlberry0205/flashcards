# FlashCards Project 

In this project, I was asked to write a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! ðŸ˜±  Once the project is finished, users will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- ES6 classes
- TDD, Mocha, Chai

## Project Goals/and Future Features
- With mre time, I would love to make this a full functioning game for a user to play.
- I would love to add a timer for the users

## How to View Your Code in Action

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to start your server to test your functionality.
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
